In column G one can enter the position of the 1S peak. In columns I and J, you will then get the size and molar extinction coefficient from Jasieniak's paper. In column B, you can enter in lines 2-6 the experimental input parameters regarding the pump. B13 then tells you the average number of absorbed photons per QD per pulse.
Poisson statistics tell us that the probability of absorbing n photons in 1 dot is related to the average number of photons absorbed per pulse per dot, N, by P_N(n)=\frac{N^n}{n!}exp{-N}. This means that the ratio of the number of dots in which we create biexcitons to the number of dots  in which we create single excitons is N/2. Therefore, in the single-exciton regime we always create biexcitons, but as a rough guide, if we excite such that N=0.1, then only about 5% of the excited dots have biexcitons. That is a fair indicator of being in the single-exciton regime.
